# PodShip

A Decentralized Podcast Sharing & Streaming Platform.

PodShip's main goal is to support Podcasters & Give the Users what they deserve.

Creator’s Benefits & PodShip’s Creator Economy:

🎙️Upload & full-Ownership of their Content. Own your Podcasts as an NFT for Free. Free Hosting on a Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS). So, today Aliens and tomorrow your Grandchildren can get insights about the world.
💰Podcasters can sell their Podcast NFT thru an Auction. And they will get NFT Royalties as well on NFT re-sales.
🔥PodShip will reward Podcasters based on the Likes/Upvotes they will get per Podcast.
💸Users will be able Tip their fav Podcasters in a seamless way.
💎By Selling Community NFTs (ERC1155) ( TBD )
User Benefits:

🎧Seamless & Un-Interrepted Streaming. Tottaly Free. No Annoying Ads.
🔒Full Data Control & Privacy Protection. No Tracking.
💰Incentives based on their engagements.
How PodShip is going to generate Revenue & How Creators & Users Rewards are gonna work.
To understand this, how Web3 Platform’s Economy gonna work. For that, pls watch this video: https://youtu.be/cPKBpmtohlI

When a User will come and create an account on PodShip, We will ask them, What their Intrest Areas are. That’s how we gonna dispaly/Recommend Podcasts to them and that’s how we are gonna Show them Ads (Display Ads, No annoying pop-ups, unskibble or Ads during streaming. Just like how brave browser does and how Odysee does. The revenue we will generate from Ads, we are gonna distribute it with the Content Creators.
then comes the second layer, In which we will say to the user, that if they want Incentives as well then have to provide more information about their selves like Location and other interests. Incentives are gonna be only for those users who will provide more info, and the info they wanna give us, We are not gonna track them. The user can delete his info whenever he wants, and his incentives will turn off as well.
And lastly, PodShip will also generate income from Podcast NFT sales. When any Podcast NFT is going to be sold, PodShip will take a small percentage.
PodShip will allow podcasters to upload content in both formats, audio & video.


We will continue building PodShip after the hackathon as well and try to mainstream it. Because the Podcast market is already Billion Dollar market and growing 🚀💰
